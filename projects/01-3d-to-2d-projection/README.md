# Project 01: 3D-to-2D Projection

The goal of this project is to understand how an object in 3D space is projected onto a 2D image plane.

## Part A:

Assume that the object is already in the camera coordinate system, i.e., the world coordinate system coincides with the camera coordinate system. This means that our extrinsics are trivial here: $$ R = I \text{ and } t = 0. $$
